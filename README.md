# gitsearch

 __gitsearch__ is built with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. The app accepts the user's github username or alias, makes a get request to _github API_ and then nicely presents the user's github information and twelve most recent repos of the user.

__Notes:__
After making a pull request, don't forget to run "npm install" so as to get other packages used in the project. Lastly, make sure to star the repo ðŸ˜Š.
